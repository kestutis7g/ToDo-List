# ToDo-List

## Task Description:

You are required to build a To-Do List application using React that integrates with a mock API to manage tasks.
The application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and retrieve tasks from the API.

## Requirements:

### User Interface:

Create a clean and intuitive user interface for the To-Do List application.
Display an input field where users can enter new tasks.
Display a list of tasks with checkboxes to mark tasks as completed and a delete button to remove tasks.
Functionality:

Implement functionality to add new tasks to the list.
Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed by checking/unchecking the checkbox.
Implement functionality to delete tasks from the list.
Integrate with a mock API to retrieve tasks from the server when the application loads.
State Management:

Utilize React state to manage the list of tasks and their properties (e.g., task name, completion status).
API Integration:

Use asynchronous JavaScript (e.g., fetch or Axios) to make HTTP requests to the mock API.
Implement API calls to retrieve tasks from the server when the application loads.
Styling:

Apply basic CSS styling to enhance the visual presentation of the application.
You may use CSS frameworks or libraries if you prefer.

### Bonus (Optional):

Implement additional features, such as task prioritization, due dates, or filtering tasks based on their completion status.
Use local storage to cache tasks and minimize API calls.
Implement error handling for API requests.
Recommended API:
For this task, we recommend using the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
It provides a set of mock endpoints for testing and prototyping, including endpoints for managing tasks (e.g., todos).
You can use the /todos endpoint to retrieve tasks for your To-Do List application.
